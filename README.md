For my coursework project, I worked with JSON data that represented the winners and runners-up of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments played annually. The project involved using data from the men's and women's tournaments, which were stored in separate JSON files. Each file contained an array of objects representing the results of a Grand Slam final, including information such as the year, tournament name, winner, and runner-up.

The main objective of the project was to create a user-friendly HTML interface that enabled users to query tournament data using JavaScript, jQuery, HTML forms, and PHP. To achieve this, I created an HTML page that allowed users to select the tournament results they were interested in and specify values such as players' names or years. Upon submitting the query, the results were displayed on the same HTML page. The project comprised three files: an HTML page, a JavaScript file referenced by the HTML page, and a PHP page that returned JSON output to be displayed on the HTML page.

Throughout the project, I gained valuable experience in handling JSON data, working with HTML forms, and using JavaScript, jQuery, and PHP for client-side and server-side processing. I was able to develop a deeper understanding of these technologies and how they can be used together to create dynamic and responsive web applications. I am proud of the work I have done on this project and believe that it demonstrates my ability to tackle complex programming tasks and deliver high-quality results.
